AdriansLib

A C# Class library for various things I find useful.

Contains:
* ImageGrid - a custom Control for displaying a 2D grid of Images (PictureBoxes).
* TextInputDialog - a custom form that is pretty easily customisable for getting input from the user.
* DebuggingTree - a custom control for displaying all an object's properties, and recurses down through child objects also.
